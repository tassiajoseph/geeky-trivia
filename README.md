Hello! My name is Tassia Joseph and I created the Geeky Trivia Food Edition. This is my first Careerdevs capstone project. I used the following to build this project:

*** CSS3
*** HTML5
*** JavaScript

I wouldn't been able to complete this project if I didn't pour countless hours watching tutorials on YouTube; reading posts on sites like MDN Web Docs, W3Schools, Stack Overflow, Geeks For Geeks; and practicing with sample code. I completed this project on Friday, Dec 3, 2021 and I'm proud of what its become. 

Thanks for reading!
